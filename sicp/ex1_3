Define a procedure that takes three numbers as arguments and returns the sum of
the squares of the two largers numbers.

(define (square x) (* x x))

(define (sum-of-squares a b) (+ (square a) (square b)))

(define (sum-of-squares-of-two-largest a b c)
  (cond ((and (< a b) (< a c)) (sum-of-squares b c))
        ((and (< b a) (< b c)) (sum-of-squares a c))
        (else (sum-of-squares a b))))
