Euclid's algorithm for calculating GCD.

(define (gcd a b)
  (if (= b 0)
      a
      (gcd b (remainder a b))))

Illustrate the process in evaluating (gcd 206 40) in normal-order
evaluation mode and indicate the remainder operations that are
actually performed.

(gcd 206 40)

' No remainder calls performed.
(gcd 40 (remainder 206 40))

' 1 remainder call performed in if. 6 != 0
(gcd (remainder 206 40)
     (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))

' 2 remainder calls performed in if. 4 != 0
(gcd (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
     (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))))

' 4 remainder calls performed in if. 2 != 0
(gcd (remainder (remainder 206 40)
                (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))
     (reaminder (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40))
                (remainder (remainder 206 40)
			   (remainder 40 (remainder 206 40)))))

' 7 remainder calls performed in if.
' 4 remainder calls performed in evaluating a.

There were a total of 18 calls to remainder.
