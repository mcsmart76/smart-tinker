The sine of an angle (specified in radians) can be computed by making use
of the approximation sin x ≈ x if x is sufficiently small, and the
trigonometric identity six x = 3 sin (x / 3) - 4 sin^3 (x / 3).

(define (cube x) (* x x x))
(define (p x) (- (* 3 x) (* 4 (cube x))))
(define (sine angle)
  (if (not (> (abs angle) 0.1))
      angle
      (p (sine (/ angle 3.0)))))

a. How many times is the procedure p applied when (sine 12.15) is evaluated?

Each step devides 12.15 by 3 until the value is < 0.1.

12.15 -> 4.05 -> 1.35 -> 0.45 -> 0.15 -> 0.05

p is applied 5 times.


b. What is the order of growth in space and number of steps (as a function of a)
used by the process generated by the sine procedure when (sine a) is evaluated?

Both space and steps are Θ(log3 a).
