The maximum value the difference could be is the difference of the
first interval's upper bound with the lower bound of the second interval,
and the minimum value the difference could be first interval's lower
bound with the upper bound of the second interval.

(define (sub-interval x y)
  (make-interval (- (lower-bound x) (upper-bound y))
                 (- (upper-bound x) (lower-bound y))))
