When evaluating a compound expression, the operator is evalauted
by fetching the expansion, then evaluating each operand in order,
and substituting in the results.

The reason new-if doesn't work is because the third operand to
new-if causes the sqrt-iter to be recursively expanded even when
the first operand (new-if's predicate) returns true. E.g. when
(good-enough? guess x) returns #t, the sqrt-iter procedure will
still be evaluated, thus expanded, keeping the cond from
being applied.
