Use the smallest-divisor procedure to find
the smallest divisor of each of the following numbers:
199, 1999, 19999.

(define (smallest-divisor n) (find-divisor n 2))

(define (find-divisor n test-divisor)
  (cond ((> (square test-divisor) n) n)
        ((divides? test-divisor n) test-divisor)
        (else (find-divisor n (+ test-divisor 1)))))

(define (square n) (* n n))

(define (divides? a b) (= (mod b a) 0))


The smallest divisor of 199 is 1999; it's prime.

The smallest divisor of 1999 is 1999; it's prime.

The smallest divisor of 19999 is 7.
