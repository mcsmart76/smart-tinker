## Point representation

; Points are pairs of numbers for the x and y coordinates.
(define make-point cons)
(define x-point car)
(define y-point cdr)

(define (print-point p)
  (newline)
  (display "(")
  (display (x-point p))
  (display ",")
  (display (y-point p))
  (display ")"))

## Segment representation

; Segments are pairs of start and end points.
(define make-segment cons)
(define start-segment car)
(define end-segment cdr)

(define (midpoint-segment s)
  (define (average x y)
    (/ (+ x y) 2))
  (make-point (average (x-point (start-segment s))
                       (x-point (end-segment s)))
              (average (y-point (start-segment s))
                       (y-point (end-segment s)))))

## Examples

(define seg (make-segment (make-point -2 4)
                          (make-point 2 -8)))


(print-point (start-segment seg))     ; (-2,4)
(print-point (midpoint-segment seg))  ; (1,-2)
(print-point (end-segment seg))       ; (4,-8)
